            This class constitutes the foundational circuit analysis techniques
            and knowledge required for future courses such as EE411, Circuit Theory
            and upper division courses in Electrical Engineering. Among the topics
            learned in this class are:
            <ul>
                <li>Operational Amplifiers</li>
                <li>Mesh/Node Analysis</li>
                <li>Thevenin and Norton Equivalents</li>

        <h4>
            Final Lab: Build an autonomous car that can navigate an obstacle course.
        </h4>
        <p>
            While this lab was a culmination of all the technical skills we've learned
            in the course, such as soldering, interfacing, and building programs
            with Labview, ultimately it was a greater lesson in what <i>not</i>
            to do when designing and implementing a project such as an autonomous car.
        </p>
        <h5><center><u>Choose your hardware appropiately.</u></center></h5>
        <p>
            As is made quite evident in the picture above, our car was a splendid
            mishmash of trailing wires and a semi-stable cardboard frame sagging
            under the weight of not one, but <i>two</i> myDAQs plus a breadboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            This made our car unwieldy, liable to fall over backwards at a bad touch,
            and very hard to debug and construct. A friendly reminder that myDAQ
            stands for Data AcQuisition Device, not a microcontroller.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative solution to the problem was to use an Arduino microcontroller,
            unfortunately something we were made aware of almost the night before
            the lab was to be checked out. That would've massively simplified the work
            that would have to be done programming the control loops, as well as reduce
            the overall size of the car.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue (and arguably the one that killed the car) was the sensors
            we were given -a set of photoresistors for the line sensing. If held up
            to the black line, with and without direct illumination, the output
            voltage would decrease over time without fail. This means that our efforts
            to threshold the line through software and hardware ended up with little fruit.
            If I were to go back in time, I would have at the very least revised
            the development timeline to have first tested the sensors and changed
            them out before integrating them and then testing them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This case is a pretty obvious application of the lesson; although it
            has popped up outside of class, particularly in my experiences with
            IEEE RAS Region V's 2017 robot and constructing testing setups for
            UTSVT's solar array. The proper research and use of equipment, even
            as trivial as the connectors between solar cells, play a pivotal role
            in the development of any project.

        <h3 style="margin: 0;padding-top: 1em;">Intro to Computing</h3>
        <p>
            Intro to Computing is a bottom-up approach of understanding the
            complexity of computers, from low (low) level bitgates to the LC3-A
            instruction set architecture and assembly. This is the foundational
            class to EE319K, Intro to Embedded Systems, EE460N, Computer Architecture,
            and many more classes.
        </p>
        <img src="media\EE306\Connect_four.PNG" style="display:block;margin:auto; width:40%;">
        <p>
            The final lab for this class consists of creating a fully operational
            game in LC3 Assembly, in this case Connect Four. Students were expected
            to manage I/O, create subroutines, and maintain memory of the state
            of the game until an end condition is reached.
        </p>
        <p>
            A particularly interesting problem I encountered during this lab was
            that my program became large enough that PC-relative assembler instructions
            were unable to retrieve data from where they were stored. My solution
            for this was to create a subroutine that imported the "global variables"
            into local variables closer to the methods in order to provide a read-only
            copy. Since it was only read only, this subroutine is good only for
            functions such as checking for four in a row.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Another program that I made after the last lab ended was an LC3 program
            based off of the game of war. I was interested in learning about
            pseudorandom number generators, and wanted to create my own. I initially
            used a friend's prng he made for his LC3 implementation of Conway's
            Game of Life, and used that to make a primitive Game of War card game
            that unfortunately lacked a deck feature, so it only gave the player
            and the CPU a pseudorandom card based on an input seed.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I then created my own PRNG using the Linear Congruential Method
            referenced from Donald Knuth, the author of The Art of Computer Programming.
            In the future EE312 Intro to Software Design class, I and my partner
            will implement Go Fish in C++, that works with a pregenerated deck.

            Easily my favorite class of the semester, Intro to Embedded Systems
            explores the interaction between computers and the outside world.
            Among the topics covered during this class are:
            <ul>
                <li>interfacing</li>
                <li>analog to digital converters and vice versa</li>
                <li>communication with SPI</li>
                <li>interrupts</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this class I worked with the Tiva TM4C microcontroller, using at
            first ARM Thumb2 Assembly to create things like a finite state machine
            traffic light and then later on, C to make a keyboard with switches.
            Our final project involved creating a whole game from scratch, and I
            created and soldered the interfacing for the TivaBoy.
        </p>
        <img src="media\EE319K_final_project\circuit schematic v1.png" style="display:block; margin:auto; width:60%;">
        <p>
            One of the really taxing parts of this project was implementing the game
            itself, a stripped down version of a Pokemon battle. I spent a <i>lot</i>
            of time getting the fundamental TivaBoy working, drivers and all, and
            allocated too little time (context: this was my entire month of May)
            to actually program the game. In retrospect, it would have been less
            stressful to implement a mechanically simpler game, like Pong, and add
            an interesting twist on it. In addition, it would probably be better, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I'm pretty glad overall about this project, since it allowed me
            to encounter a lot of the problems that a developer would face when
            working to integrate their application with the base hardware, such as
            creating and manipulating graphics and sound. I did come up with a couple
            cool solutions, such as a virtual buffer and repurposing the previous
            piano lab to output music with the pitiful memory requirements we had.

            Credits to my lab partner, Tatiana Flores, who helped me throughout our
            labs to allow me to learn so much, my roommate, Jason Nguyen, for CADding
            and 3d printing the chassis, and Augustus, who lended his solder skills
            to beautifully finish the first TivaBoy.

            The TivaBoy is still an ongoing project, and I've designed it so that
            its modular and any game I can think of can probably be programmed on
            there. I'm currently redesigning a <a href="projects.html">plan</a>
            in which I can play more advanced music (see <i>chords</i>) with the
            DAC using a custom file format that is generated with OpenCV using
            optical music recognition.

        <h3 style="margin: 0;padding-top: 1em;">How Things Work</h3>
        <p>
            How Thinks Work is a class that explores the design of processes and
            objects, from traffic simulations to cars. This class invites a lot
            of outside professors and industry professionals to come and talk about
            what they do, and how does what they do work. Among the many interesting
            talks held in the class is one about the Innovation Station, a 3D printing
            vending machine created by UT mechanical engineering students in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
            This class focuses in on the design process, from ideation to customer
            feedback, and from prototyping to refinement. Each discussion session
            decides on a singular type of product to make, and groups go out and
            make their own prototypes of that that product. For our group, we decided
            to make an automated pet feeder to tackle the issue of leaving a pet
            at home alone for a vacation, or reducing the workload of what was
            previously a tedious chore.
        </p>
        <img src="media\UGS303_project\Assembly.jpg"
            style="display:block; margin:auto; width:40%;">
        <p>
            In this project, I led the development of the circuitry and interfacing
            of sensors to the pet feeder, as well as the arduino programing and
            testing to integrate all the sensors together. The electrical components
            consisted of three potentiometers that adjusted the time of feeding
            and stepper motor that adjusted the opening to allow food to come out
            of the nozzle of the pet feeder.
        </p>
        <img src="media\UGS303_project\Control_box.jpg" style="display:block; margin:auto; width:40%;">
        <p>
            Altogether, it was a pretty simple project programming wise, but one
            of the issues we had was putting all of the wires and the microcontroller
            into the control box. The end solution was to carefully align the
            wiring so that there was minimal width used along the breadboard to
            properly place it between the Arduino and the knob potentiometers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue design wise that we stumbled upon was the slider
            that allowed food in and out. There is a little groove that keeps the
            slider in place, but that can jam up with pet food. A solution to this
            would be to remove the lower groove and keep the top groove to keep the
            slider, or even better, modify the slider be raised vertically instead
            of horizontally.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this class taught me a lot about design requirements and the
            design process, especially the need to iteratively design in order
            to probe out problems in earlier prototypes. I think this skill is
            definitely important when working for a company that creates a physical
            (or even virtual) product in order to create a polished idea.
