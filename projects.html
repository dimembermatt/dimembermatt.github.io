        <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
        <hr style="margin:0 10%;">
        <p>This project was built in collaboration with Ryan Menghani and Gauraang Dhamankar
          at UT. We decided to create a web music visualizer, using MDN's
          Web Audio API to grab MP3 data and the P5 API to create easy graphics.
        </p>
        <p>In particular, this version of the visualizer uses a particle system in which
          stationary dots are manipulated by their peers. This allowed the visualizer to
          simulate creative visuals like water waves or fizzy bubbles.
        </p>
        <p>One of the features in this application is the use of a rudimentary beat
          detection; a biquad filter was used on the frequency data analysed from the
          song and was averaged - when the amplitude of a low frequency was large enough,
          a "beat" was detected and the visualizer draws a pattern on the canvas
          (imagine a box cordoned into sections, drawing a pattern means pouring water
          into some sections and then opening the sections, releasing the water).
        </p>
        <p>Another feature is a separate mode, based off of cellular automata. It's
          very similar to Conway's Game of Life, in which a particle "lives" based on
          whether 3 or 4 neighboring cells are alive. This gives the visualization a
          unique shimmering effect where particles warp in and out of existence through
          their size.
        </p>
        <!--when server is up, update href-->
        <a href="404.html">Checkout the visualizer here!</a>
        <p>On one of the first iterations of this project, I intended to make a pseudo-
          physics particle system in order to emulate waves, but that turned out south
          after considering the ramifications (interactions with > 2 particles, size vs
          field of influence, etc). But I did end up with something cool at least!

        <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
        <hr style="margin:0 10%;">
        <p>While the Web Audio Visualizer was a big part of this summer, my other main
          project is enhancing the TivaBoy (c) Music Player that I made during the last
          couple weeks of my freshman year at UT. After making a small video game for our
          final project (<a href="https://dimembermatt.github.io/old.html#Coursework">Pokemon!</a>),
          I decided to create a small audio player for simple songs before finals because
          I <i>really</i> wanted to get audio working correctly on the TivaBoy.
        </p>
        <p>I had previous issues with it before when trying to get sound effects from wav files,
          so I decided to at first build off a previous "piano" lab where notes were
          played at pure tones successively from a premade array that I hand transcribed.<br>
          It <i>works</i>, but I can't play chords, and if I want a song any longer than 1
          sheet page I would be spending hours transcribing music.
          <br> So I decided to automate it.
        </p>
        <p>Everything about Music Box V2 can be simplified in this diagram.

          The visualization on the bottom left was kinda the prototype idea for the
          Web Audio Visualizer, but I'm glad it turned out to be very good as it is now.
          I have some ideas of how to make it work with the interpretable format I have
          now that will work with the other parts, but I probably won't get to it any
          time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the other parts though, the optical music recognition and playing a new
          format on the TivaBoy, is quite ambitious. There are writeups of how its going
          to be implemented, but truthfully I'm not quite sure how feasible they are in
          the initial timeline I want (by the middle of August). I'm getting there, though!
