        <img src="media\AudioVisualizer\VisualizerInAction.PNG" style="margin:auto; width:90%;">
        <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
        <hr style="margin:0 10%;">
        <p>This project was built in collaboration with Ryan Menghani and Gauraang Dhamankar
          at UT. We decided to create a web music visualizer, using MDN's
          Web Audio API to grab MP3 data and the P5 API to create easy graphics.
        </p>
        <p>In particular, this version of the visualizer uses a particle system in which
          stationary dots are manipulated by their peers. This allowed the visualizer to
          simulate creative visuals like water waves or fizzy bubbles.
        </p>
        <p>One of the features in this application is the use of a rudimentary beat
          detection; a biquad filter was used on the frequency data analysed from the
          song and was averaged - when the amplitude of a low frequency was large enough,
          a "beat" was detected and the visualizer draws a pattern on the canvas
          (imagine a box cordoned into sections, drawing a pattern means pouring water
          into some sections and then opening the sections, releasing the water).
        </p>
        <p>Another feature is a separate mode, based off of cellular automata. It's
          very similar to Conway's Game of Life, in which a particle "lives" based on
          whether 3 or 4 neighboring cells are alive. This gives the visualization a
          unique shimmering effect where particles warp in and out of existence through
          their size.
        </p>

        <a href="https://dimembermatt.github.io/Web-Audio-Visualizer/">Checkout the visualizer here!</a>
        <p>On one of the first iterations of this project, I intended to make a pseudo-
          physics particle system in order to emulate waves, but that turned out south
          after considering the ramifications (interactions with > 2 particles, size vs
          field of influence, etc). But I did end up with something cool at least!

        <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
        <hr style="margin:0 10%;">
        <p>While the Web Audio Visualizer was a big part of this summer, my other main
          project is enhancing the TivaBoy (c) Music Player that I made during the last
          couple weeks of my freshman year at UT. After making a small video game for our
          final project (<a href="https://dimembermatt.github.io/old.html#Coursework">Pokemon!</a>),
          I decided to create a small audio player for simple songs before finals because
          I <i>really</i> wanted to get audio working correctly on the TivaBoy.
        </p>
        <p>I had previous issues with it before when trying to get sound effects from wav files,
          so I decided to at first build off a previous "piano" lab where notes were
          played at pure tones successively from a premade array that I hand transcribed.
          It <i>works</i>, but I can't play chords, and if I want a song any longer than 1
          sheet page I would be spending hours transcribing music.
          <br> So I decided to automate it.
        </p>
        <p>Everything about Music Box V2 can be simplified in this diagram.

          The visualization on the bottom left was kinda the prototype idea for the
          Web Audio Visualizer, but I'm glad it turned out to be very good as it is now.
          I have some ideas of how to make it work with the interpretable format I have
          now that will work with the other parts, but I probably won't get to it any
          time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the other parts though, the optical music recognition and playing a new
          format on the TivaBoy, is quite ambitious. There are writeups of how its going
          to be implemented, but truthfully I'm not quite sure how feasible they are in
          the initial timeline I want (by the middle of August). I'm getting there, though!

        <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
        <hr style="margin:0 10%;">
        <p>This was a quick, couple day project I did at the end of July. I've
          recently been intrigued by <a href="http://reas.com">generative art</a>
          after the Web Audio Visualizer project, and wanted make my own little
          programs that created designs based off of "natural" systems.
        </p>
        <p>In particular, I wanted to model gravitational attraction (being in EM physics class
          for summer credit right now), and so built classes of objects that moved
          based on vector acceleration (This was a problem particularly for the particle
          system I tried to implement for the visualizer earlier).
        </p>
        <p>Here are five that I've made right now; you can right click on the
          titles to access the browser window/codepen and inspect them to see the source code.
          You can also right click and save the screen as an image to use as a background or
          screensaver.

          <a href="Generative_Drawings\orbits.html">Orbits</a>
          <p>This one in particular is a simulation of particles under gravity
            (by each other, or by a stationary "black hole"). Thirty "planets"
            are spawned over time, and they are attracted to each other to form
            semi-regular orbits. If you uncomment in the Gravity_Bodies.js code
            lines 45-48 (with the strokes and lines) in the inspector, you can see
            scaled vectors of the velocity and acceleration.

          <a href="Generative_Drawings\traces.html">Traces</a>
          <p>Traces is a modified version of Pointless, where the background has a
            a reduced opacity, allowing trails of the particles to fade away slowly
            as they fly across the window. In addition, the acceleration vectors
            are reduced, minimizing curving of the objects.
          </p>

          <a href="Generative_Drawings\pointless.html">Pointless</a>
          <p>Pointless (ha ha) is the first iteration I made, in which very fast
            particles move around a static canvas. They have a larger acceleration
            than Traces, allowing them to curve back on themselves if they bounce
            off the walls.

          <p>This was a fun demo to make, using Perlin noise to direct particles across the canvas
            to flow in various directions, like water currents. I followed around with the base
            code with Dan Shiffman's Coding Train tutorial series, but split up around the
            middle to build my own implementation. It was very interesting to see how
            similar our end simulations ended up, although we had slightly different ideas
            on how to implement movement and boundary checking.
          </p>
          <p>For this demo, there was really a lot of ways to create different representations
            of the system, from purely displaying the flowfield as like a heatmap to showing
            particle flows and their traces like a kind of organic tunnel system.
            Make sure to check it out! I think it would be interesting to make a similar
            simulation, but instead of regions of differing vector directions, have regions
            of different "height" or "pressure", forcing particles to flow in one general
            directions, such as "down a hill and into a basin."

          <p>This project was done for the purpose of learning how to access and modify
            the pixels array that P5.js uses to represent its canvas display. I decided
            to take what I learned about Perlin Noise from the FlowField demo and run
            images through a filter.
          </p>
          <h5>I used the following algorithm:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a threshold by first passing all pixels through a loop
              and grabbing the average of their RGB values.</li>
            <li>Use that first threshold and run through the pixel array again,
              but for each pixel's R,G,B value, check if they exceed the threshold.
              If they do, apply a modifier created by grabbing noise values at the
              start of each block of pixels (of arbitrarily chosen size).</li>
            <li>After passing through the image, update the image with the new RGB
              values, and continue iterating until paused.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Step two previously had the noise recalculated for every pixel, but that
            posed a problem of being computationally intensive (to the point of crashing
            Chrome). This was solved by reapplying the noise for every set of pixels,
            whose size strongly determines the resulting design.
          </p>
          <p>For example, there is a comment in the codepen that suggests the value 19
            in the line
          </p>
          <h5 style="margin:0 10%;"><b>[68]</b> ...if( i/(d*width/(width/19)) == blockIdx ) {...}</h5>
          <p>can be adjusted to 25 or 100. If the value is 100, the resulting image is like the top left image in
            the first slide of the slideshow, with horizontal bars of "static" across similar
            regions. If the value is 19 or 25, the tendency is to have a more blob or fine grain texture
            in the static. In fact, this is true for all values indivisible cleanly by 4.
            Values such as 24, or 80, produce visually similar images to 100. It will take
            me a little bit to ponder why this is the case, but it possibly might have to do with
            the fact that the index, i, increases by 4 for every iteration since each pixel uses
            4 indices for RGBA values.
          </p>
          <p>Another unexpected result of this demo is that drawings, like web art, do not
            produce as fragmented pictures. This is likely because pictures hold a lot more contrast
            across the image where web art has more even distributions of flat colors.
          </p>
          <p>Application wise, this would be really cool as a noise filter for images.
            Looking through GIMP's noise filters, there isn't anything like this that
            applies noise in correlation with the current picture color. However, it
            should be acknowledged that there is a challenge in picking good values
            for number of iterations, since at some point the image is blurred out beyond
            recognition going through so many passes.

        <h5>Future Plans</h5>
        <p>I'm currently planning to make a demo where the particles are
          simulated inside an electric field. This could be a possible
          visualizer idea where the flow of particles between a capacitor could
          be represented by waveform data or frequency data.
        </p>
        <h5>There's More...</h5>
        <p>These are actually only a few of the works that I've done over the past month
          on Generative Art (I even have a notebook of more ideas I haven't used yet). If
          you want to see the whole group of 'em, as well as the source code (on Github),
          here's a link to the
          <a href="https://dimembermatt.github.io/Generative_Art/">Generative Art Gallery</a>
          and the <a href="https://github.com/dimembermatt/Generative_Art">Github Repo</a>.
