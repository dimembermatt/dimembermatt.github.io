      <p style="padding-left:0;">EE302 Final Project</p>
      <p>
        The EE302 final project was for me, many things. It was a delight, since it was
        the first interaction we had with anything near robotics and real-application
        circuits at UT ECE. It was a huge learning curve, since the last lab was basically
        "How to read a photoresistor." And it was a huge amount of angst, after maybe a
        week of building to find out that we were severely imited by hardware problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I and one of my teammates, Brent, were in charge with the circuit design and robot
        assembly and our other teammates did the programming and software in Labview.
        It was only until the night before during debugging that we found out that our
        threshold sensing from our photoresistors weren't calibrating properly at all,
        so our robot would vary dramatically in its ability to line follow across runs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hour before our test, we found out that as we held the photoresistor above
        the line the values decreased indefinitely! Soldering, taping, wire twisting
        the photoresistor lines together didn't help at all, so this was a big lesson
        for us in the importance of hardware, which was later compounded for me at the
        later stages of Region V and Pacbot.

              Our EE302 Final project car, dubbed the 'Pico Bot (squared)', is one of
              the bulkiest entrants of its kind. In order to run its complicated line
              and wall following algorithms, two myDAQs are placed on a cardboard housing
              connected to a whole lot of sensors.

        Intro to Computing brought to the table a number of concepts that weren't
        covered in your ordinary high school CS class. We delved deeper into the microarchitecture
        of computers, in this case the Little Computer 3b and looked at how its low level
        commands (starting right from the binary!) ran through data paths and performed
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The class explored the various types of instructions and their relevance
        -leading very smoothly into EE319K's more practical applications using the ARM Thumb-2-
        and at the end our final lab was to implement Connect-4 in LC-3.

        <br>After the class ended, during winter break, I was so enthused by my newfound
        tools in assembly that I spent a considerable amount of time to make an
        emulator for the card game 'War'. I had a lot of fun, in particular, learning how
        pseudo random generators worked, after begging my Robotathon friend to lend me prng
        code that he used for his own LC-3 game, 'Conway's Game of Life' and thinking, "how
        could I make this even better?", then making my own.

        Intro to Embedded Systems has been ultimately my favorite class ever, hands down.
        While the class was an immense suck up of my time, both academically and personally,
        I don't think I would've found an appreciation and admiration of a subject in such a
        short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The class, while in some ways a build off of EE306, and the self learning I did in C
        over the winter break, introduced me to a world I didn't know I needed, the union of my
        desire to work with physical applications and admiration of the simplicity and organization
        of programming. Professor Yerraballi (and the horde of TAs) went through the ropes of
        interfacing, including drivers, potentiometers, and DACs. We delved into topics that ranged
        from duty cycles to FSMs to baud rate and communication.

              This was, inarguably, my entire month of April this year. Ever since the
              Professor Yerraballi announced the final lab, all I could think about was this project.

              The TivaBoy, designed using the TM4C Tiva Microcontroller, features
              a TFT display breakout, a 4-button D-pad, an A and B button, a volume slider,
              an audio jack and speaker, as well as a port for serial communication (with other TM4Cs).
            </p>
            <p>
              It was designed so that anyone could program a game and run it on the TivaBoy
              (considering memory and RAM constraints). Use the volume slider to move a sprite
              in a bullet hell game? You can do that. A joystick using the D-pad buttons?
              Go right ahead. You're only limited by your imagination.

              A really cool aspect of this project was that my Mech-E roommate, Jason,
              designed the chassis for the TivaBoy and we put it all together. One of the
              challenges we had was getting the D-pad to properly initiate the switches,
              which means it could be too loose (or it'd fall out or the user would have to
              press really hard in) or too tight (and the switches would always be pressed).

              Wiring and soldering this project was a roller coaster ride. Hours planning
              where to put the components, soldering in the dorm room at two in the morning
              on a monday (not my best idea), and dozens of circuit QA checks to make sure
              nothing was broken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, my lab partner had her awesome friend at Cirrus Labs, Augustus, help
              us finish soldering the other half the same day. His work was so good it brought
              tears to our eyes.

              A week before soldering the protoboard circuit, I made this circuit diagram.
              It has all the features I was fantasizing about for the final lab project, and a
              lot (if not all) of elements in it appear in previous EE319K labs. I think it's
              a pretty accurate representation of all the circuit interfacing knowledge I've
              gained over the semester.

              As of the competition day, this is the completed product (diassembled).
              The game I was emulating was Pokemon, playing a Pokemon battle between the
              player and a rudimentary NPC. The main.c code is easily over 1k lines, not
              to mention all the drivers I wrote for it as well, like the virtual buffer
              graphics and the triple interrupts for sound. Looking back, if I had went
              with a simpler game and made that more amazing I would've had a better shot
              going into the 'superfinals' but I don't regret a thing.

        Summary: This undergraduate signature course focuses on
        customer research, product design, and prototyping. Student groups choose a product
        to work on and then design it from scratch, learning skills in product requirements,
        CADding, programming, and the design process.

        Overall I think that this class was extremely rewarding for me. It did have its
        ups and downs (scheduling a group meeting was a nightmare for all involved), but I
        learned a lot more about what goes into making a real, marketable product than just
        going to an Amazon seminar. This was my first major project in a couple of years
        with Arduino, so I'm a lot more comfortable with it now, a lot of the work I did
        involving programming and circuit design built off of the Embedded Systems class at
        the same time.

              At the last stage of assembly for our pet feeder. One of my teammates,

              This is the very sketchy circuit for the control box of the pet feeder.
              A problem we had to work with during prototyping was the small size of
              the 3d printed control box, so it took a couple of hours to get the circuit
              design slim enough to fit (wires, potentiometer knobs, power cord and all).
            </p>
            <p>
              We had to make a lategame design change to chisel a hole in the side wall of
              the wooden plank to get the power cord to fit into the barrel jack of the arduino.
              I don't know about other people, but I thought that was kinda ingenious...

              Definitely a highlight of my freshman year, Robotathon was a fast-paced
              month where teams of four build autonomous robots to achieve an objective.
              This year the theme was "RAScars", and we had to design a robot that could
              maneuver an obstacle field to reach the other opponent's RAScar.

              During the Robotathon Kickoff and the following workshops, we attended
              seminars that taught us the basics to get us started on our robot. CADding
              in Solidworks, writing sensor control loops using Rasware (<i>"A generic
              robotics controller for the EK-LM4F120XL Stellaris Launchpad<"</i>), even

              In this project, I participated in the creation of the mechanical design
              for the PicoBot, CADding the first iteration prototype. The design in its
              second iteration has two layers, the second with an access hole cut to allow
              access to the top and bottom ports of the Launchpad, and providing more space
              for components such as the circuit and the sensors. The front end is angular
              to push obstacle blocks out of the way. Our algorithm setup was pretty simple
              in that we decided to use only the line sensor array in order to traverse the field.
              I laser cut both the prototypes (one of my favorite skills I learned this year),
              learning both how to operate the machines and the RetinaEngrave proprietary software.

              I worked this year in the Mechanical subcommittee (for motivations unknown

              robot. We split it down and developed further, and I was tasked with much
              of the assembly and creation of its respective parts.

              It was in this club that I learned about and spent much of my time in the

              RetinaEngrave, and Inkscape. I worked with and around the laser cutters as
              well as the 3d printers (CraftBot and its respective Craftware software),

              Working on this robot was a lot of fun, and although we had kinks during
              its development (PCB failures at the testing stage, height limitations when
              we found out some parts were too high, motor control issues, etc), this
              was a great experience in learning about how important design and iteration
              is during the development of robots and other products that require interaction
              between different fields of engineering.

              PacBot was a committee that started in the second semester of my

              is more closely similar to MicroMouse in that the autonomous robot
              -small enough to fit in the palm of your hand- navigates a maze.
              In our case, our robot was to navigate a maze and avoid ghosts, attempting
              to eat as many "pellets" as possible. This was achieved by using sensors
              to navigate the maze as well as communication with a server that displayed
              our position, the position of the ghosts, as well as the pellets to pick up.

              Probably the biggest hurdle in the development of the PacBot
              was the components we were using, since one TOF was dead on arrival
              and we had issues trying to communicate data across I2C with a chip
              that didn't accept register values larger than a couple bits (with the
              register we wanted to access being maybe in the upper 200s). This
              problem persisted pretty late into the game up until the competition.

              The task this year was to pour a bowl of cereal, so we designed a 20+ step
              machine centering around the theme "Crazy Hotel".
              <br>We had three floors, and separate rooms such as the lobby, hotel room,
              garden, etc, where we implemented objects such as slides, elevators, and many
              flying objects.

                We were commissioned by Reliant Energy to help make a Rube Goldberg
                machine for their advertisement. It was fun and enlightening to see
                them film the commercial, as well as design and set up our part.

              In addition to that, we also built machines for Cockrell Con and Reliant
              for an advertisement commercial. It was a lot of fun demonstrating to both
              kids and adults some of our steps, and a very fulfilling experience.

        I went to two hackathons during my freshman year, HackUTD and EarthHack/HackDFW
        respectively.

              Definitely a highlight of my freshman year, Robotathon was a fast-paced
              month where teams of four build autonomous robots to achieve an objective.
              This year the theme was "RAScars", and we had to design a robot that could
              maneuver an obstacle field to reach the other opponent's RAScar.
