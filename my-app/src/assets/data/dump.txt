<h4>ASME Design Team</h4>
<p>The ASME Design Team, formerly known as the Rube Goldberg team, is a fun group that participates in various activities from Case Competitions, to making a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kVa0vDNw5E" target="_blank"> commercial with Reliant Energy</a>, to trekking out to Purdue University and winning third place in the National Chain Reaction Competition with our Rube Goldberg machine.</p>
<p>As a member of this org, I have fun de-stressing from high-pace environment of my other responsibilities, putting my creative skills to the test by building engaging low-tech contraptions.</p>

<h4>UT Solar Vehicles Team</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.longhornracing.org/solar-vehicle" target="_blank">UTSVT</a> is a large group under the Longhorn Racing parent organization, in which we are building a solar car for competition in 2020. As the Solar Array subteam lead, I and my team are responsible for soldering, laminating, and assembling large solar arrays that are put in place on top of the vehicle.</p>
<p>I've learned lot of technical skills here, among them SMD soldering, cell testing and characterization, and manufacturing techniques to produce the solar modules with the optimal power generation capabilities.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this group in the Development of a Solar Powered Vehicle class, and was enthralled ever since. I intend to stay with the team for a while to come.</p>

<h4>UT Socially Intelligent Machines Lab</h4>
<p>I joined this group in Spring 2019, and I've had a great opportunity to work with other graduate student researchers on their robots. Over the last semester, I was put in charge of writing a comprehensive documentation for project setup, as well as designing and 3D printing a revised support for one of the robot's, Poli's, computers.</p>
