    Additionally, I work on a lot of personal projects outside of my academic and extracurricular obligations. Many of these projects are interesting, unique, and functional ideas that expand my knowledge of electrical and computer engineering as well as provide tangible results on my resume.
</p>
<p>
   A couple examples include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using Markov chains and stochastic matrices to create images with emergent features</li>
    <li>A web audio visualizer</li>
    <li>A redesign of my Embedded Systems handheld gaming console with PCBs instead of the current protoboard iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tch8Sm8Qmi_e3A_R3nxn65U5IdF7jdvWCyOgl-Evudg/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> of current and future projects, which is sure to keep me busy and engaged in the long term.

    I love to hear interest from others, so feel free to contact me with questions, potential collaborations, your past projects that you think are interesting, or even tips and advice on how to improve.
