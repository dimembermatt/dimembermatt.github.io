Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven
<br><br>
Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
<br>
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
<br>
The blue and the dim and dark cloths
<br>
Of night and light and the half light,
<br>
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
<br>
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
<br>
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
<br>
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;~W.B. Yeats
