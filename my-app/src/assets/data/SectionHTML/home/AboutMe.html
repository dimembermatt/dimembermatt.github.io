    I'm a junior at UT Austin, and interned at Cisco Systems Summer 2019 with the CX department in software engineering. In Summer 2020, I will be interning with Qualcomm in software engineering.

<h3>Hands-On.</h3>
<p>
    I'm a action oriented person who enjoys working on projects like embedded systems, robots, and software design, utilizing tools like Solidworks, OpenCV, and Xilinx Vivado to create tangible, impressive ideas.
</p>
<h3>Creative.</h3>
<p>
    I've designed my own handheld game console, crafted this personal portfolio website, and have won <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.26153/tsw/966">1st place</a> at the Images of Research Competition for representing chaos theory through generative art.
</p>
<h3>Dreamer.</h3>
<p>
    I want to make an lasting impact on myself, my colleagues, and everyone around me. I'm interested in robotics, autonomous vehicles, mixed reality, and rockets. And to that end, I'm engaged in a variety of groups, from my robotics organization to Rube Goldberg, building my skillset, making connections, and gaining experience.
</p>
<h3>Passionate.</h3>
<p>
    In my free time, I listen to music and podcasts like Freakonomics, make generative art, and work on personal projects.
