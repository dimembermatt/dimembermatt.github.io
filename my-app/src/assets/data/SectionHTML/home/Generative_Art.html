[i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]
<br><br>
i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
<br>
my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
<br>
i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done
<br>
by only me is your doing,my darling)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i fear
<br>
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
<br>
no world(for bea, and I'm a wizard in training. utiful you are my world,my true)
<br>
and itâ€™s you are whatever a moon has always meant
<br>
and whatever a sun will always sing is you
<br><br>
here is the deepest secret nobody knows
<br>
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the background
<br>
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
<br>
higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
<br>
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
<br><br>
i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;~E.E. Cummings
