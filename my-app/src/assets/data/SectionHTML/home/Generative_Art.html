    This section directs to my Generative Art Gallery, a project page in which I have showcased some (eventually, most) of the programs that I've made since summer 2018 in order to create interesting and visually appealing art.

    Of note, I was recently awarded 1st place for the UT Images of Research Award for my work with chaos theory and the Chirikov standard map, shown below (you can right click on the image to open it up in a new tab at full resolution):

    This was a part of a <a href="https://dimembermatt.github.io/Generative_Art/">larger generative art project</a> in which I experimented with kicked rotators and Henon Strange Attractors. Works were created in both Javascript and C++, using the p5js and OpenFrameworks libraries, respectively.
