In an effort to align my schoolwork with my interests and goals, I've chosen the Embedded Systems/Computer Architecture technical core for my ECE degree. In this challenging core, I am exposed to a variety of concepts from low level hardware to high level algorithms and software. I've taken relevant coursework in the following:
<ul>
    <li>Engineering Communications</li>
    <li>Circuit Theory</li>
    <li>Digital Logic Design</li>
    <li>Intro to Embedded Systems</li>
    <li>Software Design and Implementation I</li>
    <li>Software Design and Implementation II</li>
    <li>Development of a Solar Powered Vehicle</li>
</ul>
And this fall, I will take in particular:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/undergraduate/courses/313" target="_blank"> Linear Systems and Signals</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/undergraduate/courses/360c" target="_blank"> Algorithms</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/firefly-ut-reinventing-rocket-engineering-education" target="_blank"> Rocket Engineering Practicum</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/undergraduate/courses/351k" target="_blank"> Probability and Random Processes</a></li>
</ul>
