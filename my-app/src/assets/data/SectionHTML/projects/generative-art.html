<h3>Summer 2018 - Present</h3>
<p>
    Previously what was a couple day project at the end of July 2018, this project has become my longest lasting (besides the redevelopment of my personal site) and most fruitful.
</p>
<p>
    It started out after the work with the Web Audio Visualizer project described above, in which I was intrigued by <a href="http://reas.com">generative art</a> and wanted to make my own programs that created designs based off of mathematical or natural phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
    Since then, I've churned out at maybe about a dozen small and large programs to generate art; and have about two dozen more sketches in a notebook I carry around. There are a lot more ideas I want to and plan to implement in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Attached below are a couple selected images; and here is a <a href="https://dimembermatt.github.io/Generative_Art/">link</a> to the Generative Art Gallery page that is deployed from another Github repository. I am planning on updating that page by the end of summer with the programs that were previously on the old projects page and with some OpenFrameworks programs that I have not yet published.
