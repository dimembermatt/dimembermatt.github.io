<p>While the Web Audio Visualizer was a big part of this summer, my other main project is enhancing the TivaBoy (c) Music Player that I made during the last couple weeks of my freshman year at UT. After making a small video game for our EE319K final project (Pokemon), I decided to create a small audio player for simple songs before finals because I <i>really</i> wanted to get audio working correctly on the TivaBoy.
</p>
<p>I had previous issues with it before when trying to get sound effects from wav files, so I decided to at first build off a previous "piano" lab where notes were played at pure tones successively from a premade array that I hand transcribed. It <i>works</i>, but I can't play chords, and if I want a song any longer than 1 sheet page I would be spending hours transcribing music. So I decided to automate it.
</p>
<p>Everything about Music Box V2 can be simplified in this diagram.

  The visualization on the bottom left was kinda the prototype idea for the Web Audio Visualizer, but I'm glad it turned out to be very good as it is now. I have some ideas of how to make it work with the interpretable format I have now that will work with the other parts, but I probably won't get to it any time soon.
</p>
<p>
  For the other parts though, the optical music recognition and playing a new format on the TivaBoy, is quite ambitious. There are writeups of how its going to be implemented, but truthfully I'm not quite sure how feasible they are in the initial timeline I want (by the middle of August). I'm getting there, though!
