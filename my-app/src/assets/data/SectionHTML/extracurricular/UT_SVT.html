<h3>Fall 2018 - Present</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.longhornracing.org/solar-vehicle" target="_blank">UTSVT</a> is a large group under the Longhorn Racing parent organization.

    I've learned lot of technical skills here, among them SMD soldering, cell testing and characterization, and manufacturing techniques to produce the solar modules with the optimal power generation capabilities.

    I was first introduced to this group in the Development of a Solar Powered Vehicle class, and was enthralled ever since. I intend to stay with the team for a while to come.
</p>
<p>
    In Spring 2019, I became the Solar Array lead, in which I led a team to solder, assemble, and laminate array modules to put onto the vehicle. We as a team tested hundreds of solar cells, laminating dozens of modules and backup modules for final array placement.

<p>
    In Spring 2020, I am now the Motor Control/Dashboard lead. I will be taking over the work of graduating leads, finishing board software, reviewing electrical and manufacturing work, and collaborating with Professor Hallock to finish up this section of the car. There's a lot of new things to learn, so I hope I can keep up with the pace!

    While we were intending on racing summer 2019 at the Circuit of the Americas, the team was unfortunately unable to get the body completed (a large set of female molds were previously broken in our trailer). In the perspective of the solar array team, we needed the body to be finished in order to apply the array on top and seal it.

<p>
    We plan on entering this car in next year's competition instead, and currently, the leads will be actively designing a new vehicle during the Spring 2020 semester.
