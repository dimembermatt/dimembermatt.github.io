<h3>Fall 2017 - Present</h3>
<p>
    I joined this organization in my first semester at UT and I am currently the acting Historian and Webmaster.
</p>
<p>
    I've participated in many of RAS's committees over the last two years, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Region V</li>
    <li>PacBot</li>
    <li>Micromouse</li>
    <li>Robotathon</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In these committees, I've done work in multiple fields, from CAD and mechanical assembly, to electronics interfacing, to high level algorithm design and vision stacks. Below is a picture of our 2017-2018 Region-V robot chassis that I worked on:

    Besides my work in the committees, I'm also in charge of adding blog posts and updating the content of our organization site, at <a href="https://ras.ece.utexas.edu/">https://ras.ece.utexas.edu/</a>. There's quite a few things I want to work on for the site this summer, so new content may pop up.

    RAS in general has been formative in my career as a student and for my interest in robotics and embedded systems. You can often find me in the RAS office doing schoolwork or plotting out a new FSM algorithm for micromouse.
</p>
<p>
    In the midterm, I want to continue working with the Region v and Micromouse committees to create competitive robots for competition. In addition, however, I'm also interested in our Demobots group and our tentative RoboSub group, both of which are planning out some cool things.

    Below are a couple more images from my time at RAS.
