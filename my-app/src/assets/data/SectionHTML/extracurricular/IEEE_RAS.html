<h3>Fall 2017 - Present</h3>
<p>I joined this organization in my first semester and am currently the acting Historian and Webmaster.</p>
<p>I've also participated in many of RAS's committees, such as Region V, Micromouse, and Robotathon. From these committees, I've also learned a wide range of skills, from CAD and electromechanical assembly to developing vision stacks and simulators.</p>
