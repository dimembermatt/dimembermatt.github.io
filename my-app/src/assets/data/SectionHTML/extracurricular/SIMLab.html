<h3>Spring 2019</h3>
<p>
    I joined this group in Spring 2019, and I've had a great opportunity to work with graduate student researchers on their robots. Over the semester, I was put in charge of writing a comprehensive documentation for project setup, as well as designing and 3D printing a revised support for one of the robot's -Poli- computers.

    While it was sometimes a repetitive task (I went through so many refreshed boots), this experience was a great learning run for what I am currently doing at Cisco involving debugging and setup.

    In Fall 2019, I changed tack and began work on porting over a<a href="https://github.com/rwightman/posenet-pytorch">pytorch implementation of Posenet</a> by Ross Wightman onto the SIMLab robots. Successfully doing this, I am now currently working on a collaborative project with Michelle Wen to create a pipeline to record poses using ROS, and have a classifier classify poses.
