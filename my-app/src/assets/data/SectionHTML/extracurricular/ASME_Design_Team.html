<h3>Fall 2017 - Present</h3>
<p>
    The ASME Design Team, formerly known as the Rube Goldberg team, is a fun group that participates in various activities from Case Competitions, to making a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kVa0vDNw5E" target="_blank"> commercial with Reliant Energy</a>, to trekking out to Purdue University and winning third place in the National Chain Reaction Competition with our Rube Goldberg machine.

    As a member of this org, I have fun de-stressing from high-pace environment of my other responsibilities, putting my creative skills to the test by building engaging low-tech contraptions.

    I'm less active than I used to be, but I have fun showing up sporadically at their build meetings to help out.
