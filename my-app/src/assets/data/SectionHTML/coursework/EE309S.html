<h3>Fall 2018</h3>
<p>
    This class takes the theoretical knowledge from Circuit Theory and Software Development and puts it into the real, practical work of building a solar vehicle for the 2019 Formula Sun Grand Prix. In class, we cover topics from all disciplines, from nuclear fusion to solar energy conversion to aerodynamics. Outside of class, we meet up at the Pickle campus on Saturday to work in one of the major subgroups, such as body, communications, or suspension.

    I am currently the 2019 lead of the solar array subgroup, whose primary focus is to fabricate solar modules for application onto our newest car, BeVolt. On Thursdays, we meet up in the lab in the EER to test cells, and oftentimes, I come in early to solder up a module.

    At Pickle, I finish up the modules while the rest of the team sets up the lamination bed. We then concurrently laminate modules while prepping new ones. The process is often long and cautious, since the slightest touch or mistake can irreparably break a cell or an entire module.

    However, our group gets our work done with great care and efficiency, and over the semester, we have ramped up our speed from a single 1v1 test cell to three 4x2 modules in a single day. For me, what might have previously taken two hours to solder a 4x2 module together now only takes about 20 to 40 minutes.

    I've learned a great deal thanks to this class, and intend to continue being a part of the larger UTSVT organization as well as take the upper division course in the future. Currently, the plan is to race the completed car in the 2020 FSGP.
