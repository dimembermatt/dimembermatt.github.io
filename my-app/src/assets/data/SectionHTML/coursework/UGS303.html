<h3>Spring 2018</h3>

    How Things Work is a class that explores the design of processes and objects, from traffic simulations to cars. This class invites a lot of outside professors and industry professionals to come and talk about what they do, and how does what they do work. Among the many interesting talks held in the class is one about the Innovation Station, a 3D printing vending machine created by UT mechanical engineering students in 2014.

    This class focuses in on the design process, from ideation to customer feedback, and from prototyping to refinement. Each discussion session decides on a singular type of product to make, and groups go out and make their own prototypes of that that product. For our group, we decided to make an automated pet feeder to tackle the issue of leaving a pet at home alone for a vacation, or reducing the workload of what was previously a tedious chore.

    In this project, I led the development of the circuitry and interfacing of sensors to the pet feeder, as well as the arduino programing and testing to integrate all the sensors together. The electrical components consisted of three potentiometers that adjusted the time of feeding and stepper motor that adjusted the opening to allow food to come out of the nozzle of the pet feeder.

    Altogether, it was a pretty simple project programming wise, but one of the issues we had was putting all of the wires and the microcontroller into the control box. The end solution was to carefully align the wiring so that there was minimal width used along the breadboard to properly place it between the Arduino and the knob potentiometers.

    Another issue design wise that we stumbled upon was the slider that allowed food in and out. There is a little groove that keeps the slider in place, but that can jam up with pet food. A solution to this would be to remove the lower groove and keep the top groove to keep the slider, or even better, modify the slider be raised vertically instead of horizontally.

    Overall, this class taught me a lot about design requirements and the design process, especially the need to iteratively design in order to probe out problems in earlier prototypes. I think this skill is definitely important when working for a company that creates a physical (or even virtual) product in order to create a polished idea.
