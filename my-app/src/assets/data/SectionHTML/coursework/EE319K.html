    Easily my favorite class of the semester, Intro to Embedded Systems explores the interaction between computers and the outside world. Among the topics covered during this class are:
    <ul>
        <li>interfacing</li>
        <li>analog to digital converters and vice versa</li>
        <li>communication with SPI</li>
        <li>interrupts</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In this class I worked with the Tiva TM4C microcontroller, using at first ARM Thumb2 Assembly to create things like a finite state machine traffic light and then later on, C to make a keyboard with switches. Our final project involved creating a whole game from scratch, and I created and soldered the interfacing for the TivaBoy.

    One of the really taxing parts of this project was implementing the game itself, a stripped down version of a Pokemon battle. I spent a <i>lot</i> of time getting the fundamental TivaBoy working, drivers and all, and allocated too little time (context: this was my entire month of May) to actually program the game. In retrospect, it would have been less stressful to implement a mechanically simpler game, like Pong, and add an interesting twist on it. In addition, it would probably be better, too.

    However, I'm pretty glad overall about this project, since it allowed me to encounter a lot of the problems that a developer would face when working to integrate their application with the base hardware, such as creating and manipulating graphics and sound. I did come up with a couple cool solutions, such as a virtual buffer and repurposing the previous piano lab to output music with the pitiful memory requirements we had.

    Credits to my lab partner, Tatiana Flores, who helped me throughout our labs to allow me to learn so much, my roommate, Jason Nguyen, for CADding and 3d printing the chassis, and Augustus, who lended his solder skills to beautifully finish the first TivaBoy.

    The TivaBoy is still an ongoing project, and I've designed it so that its modular and any game I can think of can probably be programmed on there. I'm currently redesigning a plan in which I can play more advanced music (see <i>chords</i>) with the DAC using a custom file format that is generated with OpenCV using
    optical music recognition.
