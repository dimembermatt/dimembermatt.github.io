    Intro to Digital Logic Design is a comprehensive course on circuit component level design (right above the mechanics of said components). It starts right from the very bottom, at NMOS and PMOS transistors, and slowly goes up, from gates to combinational and sequential logic circuits to adders and registers to large scale system design (an oft mentioned example is the circuit of a vending machine).

    This course places a strong emphasis on finite state machine design, including moore and mealy machines, as well as optimization, state encoding, and the design process from problem to circuit.

    The lab for this course was very practical; we used the Basys3 FPGA board to implement both sequential and combinational logic circuits, and towards the end I created a HLSM that implemented a stopwatch/counter (note: the video below is not of this lab).
    Accordingly, we used and learned Verilog during the course.

    Additionally, the course covers boolean algebra and properties, number systems, and logic mapping.
