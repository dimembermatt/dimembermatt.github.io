<p>
    While there aren't any amazing projects I did in this class, I have to recognize that I learned the most in this class, spending an exorbitant amount of time to improve my understanding and knowledge of the concepts.

    The content covered in this course is huge, going over a myriad of topics:
    <ul>
        <li>operational amplifiers, summing, differential, etc</li>
        <li>capacitors and inductors</li>
        <li>first order circuits, with and without sources</li>
        <li>second order circuits, dampening</li>
        <li>transient circuit response</li>
        <li>sinusoidal steady state analaysis</li>
        <li>AC power analysis</li>
        <li>three-phase circuits</li>
        <li>inductance</li>
        <li>resonance</li>
        <li>bode plots, frequency analysis</li>
        <li>filters</li>
        <li>and two port networks</li>
    </ul>
