<h3>Fall 2018</h3>
<p>
    This class builds upon the C learned in EE319K, Intro to Embedded Systems,  as well as going into C++ in the latter half of the course. Topics taught in this class includes:
    <ul>
        <li>heap memory allocation (malloc, free, new)</li>
        <li>object oriented programming</li>
        <li>recursion</li>
        <li>intro to Big O notation</li>
        <li>data structures such as linked lists, stacks, vectors, trees, heaps, hashmaps</li>
        <li>sorting implementations (i.e. mergesort, quicksort, etc)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    While a lot of this class (particularly the first half of it) was review for me, who learned Java and OOP in high school, much more of this class was an interesting delve into data structures and algorithms that I was previously unaware of, including hashmaps and priority queues using heaps.

    A majority of this class was also applied learning and practice. Among the many labs during this semester were making a game of Go Fish, building a fake IPod, and using hashmaps to find plagiarism among file sets. The last one was particularly fun, and my partner and I were quite enthused in reducing the run time of a >1.5million word set of files into sub
    2.5 seconds while maintaining good accuracy and precision.

    Among the cool algorithms that I worked on was a recursive floodfill, and while it was pretty simple, I had a lot of fun drawing it out and building it.
