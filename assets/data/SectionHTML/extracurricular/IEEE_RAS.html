<h3>Fall 2017 - Present</h3>
<p>
    I joined this organization in my first semester at UT and I am currently co-Robotathon head for 2020.
</p>
<p>
    I've participated in many of RAS's committees over the last two years, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Region V</li>
    <li>Demobots</li>
    <li>PacBot</li>
    <li>Micromouse</li>
    <li>Robotathon</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In these committees, I've done work in multiple fields, from CAD and mechanical assembly, to electronics interfacing, to high level algorithm design and vision stacks. Below is a picture of our 2017-2018 Region-V robot chassis that I worked on:

    Besides my work in the committees, I was also in charge of adding blog posts and updating the content of our organization site in 2019, at <a href="https://ras.ece.utexas.edu/">https://ras.ece.utexas.edu/</a>. 
</p>

    RAS in general has been formative in my career as a student and for my interest in robotics and embedded systems. You can often find me in the RAS office doing schoolwork or working in committee activities.

    This semester, I was the de-facto electrical lead of the Region V committee to get a robot ready for competition early April. The event has been cancelled, so our robot now has plans for a second life as the Demobots Dancebot swarm mothership. Details to follow in a blog post in the RAS site coming to you soon! As electrical lead, I mainly worked with writing driver software for our sensors and actuators, testing parts, and designing a PCB for our electrical requirements. A video of our moving base can be found below (soon!). Concurrently, I also am working with Demobots to add a waterproof front plate with LEDs and ultrasonic sensors for stopping at obstacles. In addition, I am working with Burak Biyikli, my Robotathon co-lead, to create an interesting Robotathon competition for Fall 2020.
