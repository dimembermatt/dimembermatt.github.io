<h3>Fall 2018 - Present</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.longhornracing.org/solar-vehicle" target="_blank">UTSVT</a> is a large group under the Longhorn Racing parent organization.

    I've learned lot of technical skills here, among them SMD soldering, cell testing and characterization, and manufacturing techniques to produce the solar modules with the optimal power generation capabilities.

    I was first introduced to this group in the Development of a Solar Powered Vehicle class, and was enthralled ever since. I intend to stay with the team for a while to come.

    In Spring 2019, I became the Solar Array lead, in which I led a team to solder, assemble, and laminate array modules to put onto the vehicle. We as a team tested hundreds of solar cells, laminating dozens of modules and backup modules for final array placement.

    In Spring 2020, I am now the Motor Control/Dashboard lead. I took over the work of our graduating leads, finishing board software, reviewing electrical and manufacturing work, and collaborating with Professor Hallock to finish up this section of the car.

    Given the current state of the car (and competition), it appears that we will not make it for this summer's event with a driveable car as the Pickle Research Campus is closed for the forseeable future. At the moment, the leads are conducting online calls to design our new car (a 2 seater!) and rework all of the necessary software and electrical architecture for it.
