<h3>Fall 2018 - Present</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.longhornracing.org/solar-vehicle" target="_blank">UTSVT</a> is a large group under the Longhorn Racing parent organization, in which we are building a solar car for competition in 2020. As the Solar Array subteam lead, I and my team are responsible for soldering, laminating, and assembling large solar arrays that are put in place on top of the vehicle.

    I've learned lot of technical skills here, among them SMD soldering, cell testing and characterization, and manufacturing techniques to produce the solar modules with the optimal power generation capabilities.

    I was first introduced to this group in the Development of a Solar Powered Vehicle class, and was enthralled ever since. I intend to stay with the team for a while to come.

    While we were intending on racing summer 2019 at the Circuit of the Americas, the team was unfortunately unable to get the body completed (a large set of female molds were previously broken in our trailer). In the perspective of the solar array team, we needed the body to be finished in order to apply the array on top and seal it.

    We plan on entering this car in next year's competition instead, and the leads are actively considering designing a two-seater vehicle with the incoming fall class for the competition as well.
