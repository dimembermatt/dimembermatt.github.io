<h3>Spring 2019</h3>
<p>
    I joined this group this spring, and I've had a great opportunity to work with graduate student researchers on their robots. Over the last semester, I was put in charge of writing a comprehensive documentation for project setup, as well as designing and 3D printing a revised support for one of the robot's -Poli- computers.

    While it was sometimes a repetitive task (I went through so many refreshed boots), this experience was a great learning run for what I am currently doing at Cisco involving debugging and setup.

    Now that the setup has finished, I'm planning on coming back this fall to help out more directly. I hope to learn a lot more from the team!
