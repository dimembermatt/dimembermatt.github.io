<h3>Spring 2019</h3>
<p>
    The sequel course to Software Design and Implementation I, this course is in Java, introducing new concepts such as multithreading, security, and networking.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, a lot of more Java specific concepts were taught, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>JavaFX</li>
    <li>Java exception handling</li>
    <li>Reflection</li>
    <li>Socket programming</li>
</ul>

    The lab portion was probably the most intensive portion of this course, eating up a significant portion of my time to create extensive, multilevel applications. For example, the Chat app pictured above, our last lab, took me at least several days of work, including an all nighter at the Perry Castaneda Library in order to debug and implement.
</p>
<p>
    One of the big lessons of this course is probably in software development and design: It's much easier to go from a smaller, base application, and add complexity rather than design all of the functionality at the start and not having a good test plan to test the features one by one. Disclaimer: the chat app we demoed to class was a skeleton of the actual app, which got so buggy it broke down in the end and had to be discarded.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the fustration, migraines, and many sleepless hours in this class, I certainly had a lot of fun creating tangible products, and would like to work further in creating useful and interesting applications.
