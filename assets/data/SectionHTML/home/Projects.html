Additionally, I work on a lot of personal projects outside of academic and extracurricular obligations, many of which are interesting and fun concepts that both expand my knowledge of electrical and computer engineering and provide tangible results on my resume.

A couple examples include:
<ul>
    <li>Using Markov chains and stochastic matrices to create images</li>
    <li>A web audio visualizer</li>
    <li>A current redesign of my Embedded Systems handheld gaming console to use a PCB design rather than a protoboard</li>
</ul>
